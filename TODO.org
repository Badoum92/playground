** glTF

   Vertex buffer is a custom struct not the same representation as the glTF buffer accesors.
   It only requires the pos (vec3); the normals (vec3), uv (vec2), joints/skins are not required;

   _Model_
   - one vertex buffer
   - one index buffer

   _Mesh_
   - has uniform buffer
   - its vertices and indices are stored in the model buffers
