Actual gameplay :D
x Remove all DescriptorSet and use BindlessSet instead, one set per descriptor type, global and current shader options indices should be in push constants @vulkan
x Move files around (again) to match Rust's crate structure: one folder per crate, .hpp next to .cpp, separate each "module" in a separate file, or subfolder if it has nested modules, make one namespace per module, bin have a main.cpp, libs have a lib.{cpp, hpp}
x Fetch the correct triangle in visibility shading @visibility
x Basic rendering, using a visibility buffer and raytraced AO @renderer @visibility
x Parse materials/images from glTF and upload them to GPU @renderer @gltf
x fix all warnings on msvc /W4 + clang -Wall -Wextra @project
x remove as much static/reinterpret_cast as possible
