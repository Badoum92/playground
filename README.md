# Vulkan glTF renderer

This project was made to learn graphics programming using the Vulkan API.

Features:
- Physically Based Rendering
- Voxel Cone Tracing for global illumination. (Cyril Crassin, "Interactive Indirect Illumination Using Voxel Cone Tracing" https://maverick.inria.fr/Publications/2011/CNSGE11b/GIVoxels-pg2011-authors.pdf)
- State-of-the-art Procedural Sky and Atmosphere rendering. (SÃ©bastien Hillaire, "A Scalable and Production ReadySky and Atmosphere Rendering Technique" https://sebh.github.io/publications/egsr2020.pdf)

# Installation

- Install the Vulkan SDK (https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)
- You can now build the project!

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Vincent-P/test-vulkan.git
$ cd test-vulkan
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -G Ninja ..
$ ninja
```

- The executable needs to be started from the build directory.

# Dependencies
- STB Image (https://github.com/nothings/stb)
- simdjson (https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson)
