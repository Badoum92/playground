# My own toy renderer

This project was made to learn graphics programming using the Vulkan API.

Features:
- Physically Based Rendering
- Voxel Cone Tracing for global illumination. (Cyril Crassin, "Interactive Indirect Illumination Using Voxel Cone Tracing" https://maverick.inria.fr/Publications/2011/CNSGE11b/GIVoxels-pg2011-authors.pdf)

# Installation

The only external dependency needed is the `glslc` shader compiler, you can download the latest binary build here: https://github.com/google/shaderc/blob/main/downloads.md
`glslc` should be in the PATH.

There are two presets: `default` which uses the Ninja build system with clang; and `msvc` which creates a VS2022 solution.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Vincent-P/test-vulkan.git
$ cd test-vulkan
$ cmake --preset default
$ cmake --build --preset default
```
